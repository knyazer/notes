Sleeping beauty paradox

#### The urn and the balls (Nick Bolstrom)

Ignoring the internal dependencies: we don't know whether "taking out white balls" maybe makes all other balls whiter.

#### Bayesian epistemology

While usually it is said that in bayesian epistemology you can never fully refute a theory, it does not seem correct to me: if the observation is out of theory likelihood support, the theory is "refuted" because the assigned confidence in the theory is 0.

#### Longtermism issues

When discussing longtermism it is common to hear "assume humanity living for infinity, then optimize for total happiness": good idea, the expectation is simply infinite! There is a simple way to deal with the issue, just constrain the future for "the next 1000 years", "until sun becomes read giant" or "until iron death of the universe".

A better way is exponentially discount future happiness: similarly to the Bellman equation, we make the future worth less because we are less confident in it. In fact, you can even calibrate such a value, by making a bunch of predictions, and verifying them after one year. Then you can assume every year brings you the same "incorrectness" chance, and just go into the future.

#### Climate change

There is a commonly heard discussion these days, largely popularized by Habine Hofstader, that climate change could be a lot worse than we expect. Because the models are shit.

#### Bayesian machine learning

Bayesian machine learning is a total failure: the priors are most frequently "non informative", and small modifications of the prior could lead to a totally different solution. As the result, it is common to observe practitioners tweak prior and model architecutre until getting results that are good enough. 

_My preferred way of training machine learning systems with uncertainty is conformal prediction: purely frequentist method_
